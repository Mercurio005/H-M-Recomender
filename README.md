# H-M-Recomender

Fast fashion companies, such as H\&M, are trying today to have recommendation systems in which they predict the garments that a customer can buy according to their tastes and preferences. The objective of this study is to carry out this recommendation algorithm using machine learning techniques  from which they will be compared to know which is the one that best approximates reality.  To this end, the research question  is as follows: Can you predict what the customer would like to buy in the future based on their history of past purchases? This question is answered by experiments within the data provided. This can be translated into the methodology used in which it consists of performing an exploratory analysis of the data and deciding which are the most important variables in which they will serve as parameters for the machine learning techniques such as neural networks, K-Nearest Neighbor, Principal Component Analysis, K-means, among others.  The results will be obtained by applying the aforementioned and comparing according to the evaluation metrics of each method to decide which is the one that best suits this challenge.
